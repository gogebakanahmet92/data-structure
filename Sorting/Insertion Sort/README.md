# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is appropriate for small inputs.
The list is divided into two parts: sorted and unsorted.
In each pass, the first element of the unsorted part is picked up, transferred to the sorted sublist, and inserted at the appropriate place.
A list of N elements will take at most (N âˆ’ 1) passes to sort the data.

## Insertion Sort Analysis

- Best Case    -> O(N)
- Worst Case   -> O(N**2)
- Average Case -> O(N**2)
